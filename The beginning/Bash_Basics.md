## Some Bash basics

Much like PowerShell, you can add comments to your scripts. PowerShell uses the same syntax,
the hash symbol.

Like PowerShell, it's possible to create variables in Bash. Variables allow you to store data.
In my example, I've assigned Polska=bialo_czerwoni, and you can see from my example how I used echo to call the Polska variable and realised I didn't include the $ symbol. Once I had, it gave me my output of bialo_czerwoni.

I've been practising along with the FreeCodeCamp article by Zaira - (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bash-scripting-tutorial-linux-shell-script-and-command-line-for-beginners/). There's some important things to make note of with naming conventions in Bash scripting. Firstly, variable names require either a letter or underscore as the first letter. Variable nmame can contain either letters, _ or numbers. They are case sensitve so echo polska would not have worked, for example. No space are allowed and the best practive for variable names is something descriptive.
