# A new beginning
Starting anything new is scary. I've worked on the service desk for just shy of two years (at the time of writing/typing) and I've never used Bash, nor have I ever needed to. Learning new technology is overwhelming, and with shortcuts like ChatGPT, its easy to be lazy. But knowing how to use in-demand technology without external resources will separate you from a 'vibe scripter/programmer' (not to mention how impressive it is). Sometimes, trying new things takes courage, and I just want to push myself to learn new things. If you're reading this then you might too, and hopefully you might feel inspired to keep track of what you're learning to level up.
